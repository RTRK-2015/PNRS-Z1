## How to feed your cat in Java
* Transform your cat into a class
* Instantiate your cat (as many instances as IRL cats)
* Register your cat in a IEatingListener interface
* Wait to be notified that your cat has become fat
* Pet the cat, thereby encouraging this abhorrent behaviour
* Wait for the GC to harvest the fat remains of your cat when you become fed up with it (pun intended)
